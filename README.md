This is a project to generate abstract video or images similar to the X-ray effect in some cases and just abstract and glitch in other cases, due to the use of randomness this may vary.


I will describe the workflow.

# Open processing and use the code with a video in the data folder.
The frames are saved in the frame folder.
(create frames)

# Open python and use the code make sure to select the path where the frames saved by processing are located.
(mixing frames randomly)

# Open terminal and use the ffmpeg command make sure to select the path where the frames saved by python are located.
(join frames)

The new video is located in the output folder of python
